# Seq - Parallal Sequences

Seq provides an implementation of the Parallel Sequences abstraction built on the support for shared-memory parallelism in the new OCaml 5.0.0 runtime. For example programs, see the [index](https://github.com/aytao/ParallelSequences/tree/master/index) or [matrix](https://github.com/aytao/ParallelSequences/tree/master/matrix) modules used for [benchmarking](https://github.com/aytao/ParallelSequences/tree/master/time).

For more details, please see the [paper](https://github.com/aytao/ParallelSequences/tree/master/Report.pdf) for this work.
